Basically just incase you lose your place on the page here are a few tips:

Along the top there is a path to where youre at. Simply click the Google-Sites blue heading link to go back to the start.

When copying the caleb.html file choose the raw icon after you have clicked caleb.html 

The raw icon will give you plain html to copy and paste and use inside your google sites template.

Lastly the caleb.html file has some commenting in it.

It is very easy to understand if you have a good read of it.

Aftter you paste your snippet into google sites, 
google sites will say there are bits of code we cant keep so it will remove the commenting ( just let it do that )

Come back to this site to read the commenting inside caleb.html so you can understand how to duplicate the rows for your portfolio items.
