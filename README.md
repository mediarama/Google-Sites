Basic Info On Using html to set up a simple google site.

These steps are assuming you know how to get into your own google sites account.

And that you have open a plain template for google sites.

Before i begin, please have a look at this link:

https://sites.google.com/site/blanketyblanks999/home?previewAsViewer=1

It is a preview of a google site that Cal;eb and I set up last week.

Next...

Click on the cog and choose site layout

Disable all layout sections and choose custom width 

Set custom width to 960px

Click on the cog again and choose page settings

Untick everything and simply type in a description of your site,
Google sites will add that to the code as a meta description and it wont be visible on your page but its good to do.

Now that yopui have set up your settings

Go to the Pencil ( edit ) icon and click it

Then from the editor options choose layout and select the first layout ( single column )

One box should appear in your website template area

Now using the <HTML> icon insid ethe editor tool bar paste the code snippets i have provided ( only 1 )

And click update

Now you can choose your own images to replace the ones that are there.
